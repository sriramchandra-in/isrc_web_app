<pre>Abhyasi:� � You talk about the power arc. You say there was some moonlight with some dots in, with many dots.

</pre><pre>It maybe electricity, possibility, there may be a possibility of that. Electricity. But there is something, there is power in . . .
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Is there also a power-arc between the electrons, or is it only between the atoms ?
</pre><pre>Babuji:		I find it, in atoms. And electrons ..., of course, the people talk so much about electrons and ions.
</pre><pre>So these things are other than for	particles, atoms?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	These things other than that? Electrons and ...
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes, it is inside atoms.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Inside the atoms.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	That is, they draw force from this ?.. these atoms, draw force, out of that . . . .
</pre><pre>ions, ions and,	electrons.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	What is the solar system of the atoms, you also talked about yesterday?
</pre><pre>Babuji:	It is inside.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	It is inside the atom?
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Not inside ?.. it is very difficult to describe,	Outside.

</pre><pre>Babuji: � Like a ? � ? Abhyasi: Like a cloud. Babuji: Cloud?
