<pre><b>Babuji:</b>   So, some enjoyment is also there in difficulties. Of course, if a man wants to study it, there is some enjoyment in difficulties also.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Yes. It's true.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Suppose you do not take 'chapatti', I mean this bread as we take, and suppose you take just for a change, just for a change. Some enjoyment will also be there,
</pre><pre> 
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>although you may not like it. Some enjoyment will also be there. So bitterness is itself an enjoyment. Ah no, bitterness is itself a taste.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Yes. That's true.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Similarly comfort is really discomfort. Because you are bound. I am sitting very comfortably. That is, I am bound with certain sphere or with certain circle. So when you are bound not the comfort at all, when you are free then that is the comfort. And what is the freedom there? When you are free from comfort and discomfort, then that means you are free . .
</pre><pre>I think good talk?	Another question?
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> This man wants you to say something socially about the West. But I think the mind is also social?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> No, I am telling you. I have said to you also. If you can calm down the mind of any person, that is the best social service. You want riches, I want riches, what for? So that I may pass my life very easily and comfortably. And suppose riches are not there, and you pass the life comfortably, it is itself a riches.
</pre><pre>So riches of course are for certain things, you can purchase so many things, do anything, you can have a car, aeroplane, anything, it is for that. And suppose no riches and you have got the aeroplane, and car, and everything, that means you are happy So what is the real thing? Something behind yourself, that is you are something behind yourself, not as you look.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> That is true.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> And this is a scientific process, process, I am telling you about it. When you meditate, you wait for something. Subconsciously you wait for ultimate result or ultimate goal or God or Divinity. Unconsciously you wait. That is, you have started for that, for that alone. You wait for something. Now when you wait for something and since you are at one point, you are meditating, waiting for something, so that heat produces a sort of vacuum also.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	A sort of ...
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Vacuum.
</pre><pre> 
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Vacuum.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Vacuum you understand?
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Yes.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> A sort vacuum. When that vacuum is created power begins to come. So the whole body, the whole physical frame should be vacuumized so that the whole grace may come to you. And moreover. A man gets the grace, but the way is blocked, way is blocked, and that we call it grossness. We remove the grossness, what for? So that God's grace may come directly into you, and this is the work. And when you are free from all the grossness, half of the work of the Master is over. Because you begin to get, what you call, grace directly. And He really He becomes the guru and you disciple of God.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Very finely explained.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	In talk I am ready, such a talk I can go on
</pre><pre>replying, but to deliver a speech is far difficult for me. You go on questioning, I shall answer for everything.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Unless one has a vacuum grace cannot descend into him?
</pre><pre>And that is by grossness, and I am telling you, I devote so much time in removing it, and I am having very good results also. So most of the time I devote in cleaning you. And of course transmission is alongside. So transmission is moulded for some specific purpose, that that it works. Suppose in this very transmission you mould it that I may become rich. It will not work there also. It is a sort of power. Moulding is your work.
