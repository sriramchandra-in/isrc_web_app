<pre>﻿<b>Babuji:</b> Another question ?
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> Yes. Love is that a feeling of reality?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Love? No, it is not the feeling of reality, it is the way to reality!
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> Oh yes,
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> I'm telling you. In the last run, devotion even finishes. Devotion is gone. Now you have crossed the way and you reach the goal. Everything is gone.
</pre><pre>Of course in India, there are so many books, nobody has said so. And Dr. K.C.Varadachari was telling me once, that your writings are very revolutionary, your talk is very revolutionary. I said, "I want to create a revolution, so that the people may come into the right path". So I always write revolutionary. Nobody even in India, of course except my associates, nobody in India agrees with that. But that cannot give reason. Because it is beyond their approach, from where I talk.
</pre><pre>In my oppinion the problem is that life itself may reveal its character. Do you follow? Life itself may reveal its character.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>        Its character?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> I don't know how far I'm right. But it’s my idea this time, of course. Life itself may reveal its character. And what is its character? Life in life. And that is our problem.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>        And then how to solve the problem of life?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> By meditation. And by what you call sittings by the Master. These These are the only things.
</pre><pre>This meditation, of course, if guide is there, it works wonders. And if guide is not there, sometimes, entangle comes. Entanglements comes and you are hovering there, you are not able to cross, to cross, then Master is needed.
</pre><pre>The people may do it, and they will be benefited and their thoughts will not be so, what you call, strong. This will all thing, I mean, but correct thing you can get when a Master is there. And that Master, who has crossed all these things.</pre>
