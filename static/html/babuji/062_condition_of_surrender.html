</pre><pre>Babuji:� � � I only said, that really guru should submit to his disciples. He should not expect that thing from him, but he should himself do it.
</pre><pre>And I am telling you one very good thing, our Christ has also said, surrender, in another way, "You are Gods children, you fall on his lap." Something like that, so that is surrender. Of course in another way he said, surrender. So how can you say, that my surrender ?, I have really surrendered to God. How can you say that ? New things I always say.
</pre><pre>When you feel yourself surrendered to everybody, then that means you have really surrendered to God. When you feel yourself. I never tried for that. Because at that time my age was only 21 years of age, I was at that time when I went at the feet of the Master. So I have not ?, I did not know these things, surrender, and so on.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	It only came from practice?
</pre><pre>Babuji: No, I ..., It might have come, I do not know. Because I have written on surrender also. It is when you feel yourself surrendered to everybody. That is a feeling a sort of feeling should be in that. A sort of meekness should be, then that is your belief in that God.
