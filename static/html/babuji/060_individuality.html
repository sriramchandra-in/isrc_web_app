<pre>I think, now you just talked about all this 'Anand', and bliss, and so on. I think that in West people are very afraid of losing their individuality. In being taken up.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	But they will not die. They will survive, I am telling you.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Individuality will also survive somehow, will it?
</pre><pre>Babuji:	That, that I am deadly enemy of individuality.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	I am deadly enemy!
</pre><pre>Babuji:� � What I think, you know that you are, your name is this, that is quite alright. You feel that I exist. I am a man, or I am a woman, or I am a lady, anything, you feel that. So that idea should not be there. Individual idea should not. Suppose you say, "No, I am a woman.", or "I am a man". So just you think of it, it may it may go away immediately. Rebounding, a sort of rebounding. It should not stay with you. That means individuality, individuality is lost. You should not feel that you have got body. You should not feel that you exist. And really higher, higher teaching of the mind.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	You said once, "It is very bad to feel that you exist".
</pre><pre>Babuji: And you will be the excellent worker. Suppose, that stage, excellent worker, in all your duties, you see. It will help you in all your duty. Instead of spoiling you.
</pre><pre>   Suppose you said, "I am dead." Is it a fact that you are dead? Suppose somehow, by mistake I say I am dead. Is it a fact that I am dead?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	No, it is not.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	So similarly the individuality.
</pre><pre>(Danish: Explanation of what Babuji said).
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Use the word oneness, Vibe. So oneness can come, only when you are not there.
</pre><pre>God is there when you are not there. You means egoism, or anything.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	God ?..
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	We are so used to in the west that we should be conscious, conscious all the time.
</pre><pre>Babuji: No. You will remain conscious, there is no doubt about that. That thing should be developed. But that individuality will be lost.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>   That your existence, this material existence, material existence you will not feel. And at the highest point is, that you may not feel the spiritual existence even. That is the highest. And I am the first man to say that.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Ja.
</pre><pre>Babuji:� � A man told me, he was man of vast learning. He said : "That it is you who are telling me." That is my experience, and I have written in my diary also.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Nobody can tell.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	No idea, no idea of body, no idea of soul. Then what is that? That is oneness.
</pre><pre>   That you are connected with some higher source, that is oneness. In my words. So they will ask me such questions, "What is oneness?" So this is oneness. You are not there in any way, but you are doing the work. God is not here, of course we say He is everywhere, but actually God is not here. He may be somewhere. But his working is going on.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	His working is going on.
</pre><pre>That is a very difficult point. If people could understand a little of it, they would be very much interested.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	So, I am telling you this thing . . . .
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes you are, you are, you may talk more.
</pre><pre>Babuji: I have written a few words, about that, I forget ? I am forgetting it. Something like that I have Because the whole of the philosophy I have tried to ?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	It is in your books also.
</pre><pre>Babuji:� � "I" give the shape. "I" give the shapes, that is it is a seed. "I" give the shape, that you become man. "I" give the shape. It passes through you, when you become ,
</pre><pre>when I am there, you are there. You, I use the word "I", I shapes you. No, something like that. "I" give you shape. The word "I" gives you shapes. It passes through you, and afterwards both are gone.
</pre><pre>Neither the "I" is there, nor "you" are there.
