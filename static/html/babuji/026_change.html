<pre>Every life is a new chance, God is giving us?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Unless you change your life, there will be no change!
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	No.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> But then lots of people say its Gods will; what can we do ?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> These Bhaktas and devotion. I sometimes say that, suppose if anybody dies, I'll go to him. "It is Gods will you can not do anything. Only pray for him, for the peace of the soul". That I myself say, but it is not right.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> Because if misery is created by man, so it is not Gods will, it is selfcreated misery!
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> ï¿½ So, that is, what do you call, sorrow be mitigated and something like that. Then we say such words.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> Well, can the misery collected in earlier lives be reduced by changing over, our actions?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	No I'm telling you, the method of cleaning, and Master also cleans, that reduces.
</pre><pre>Of course something comes for Bhogam, but so many thing are gone.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Does Bhogam ?.. the effect will be lessened?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Lessened.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> So here, in Sahaj Marg system formation of further samskars, what you call impressions, are stopped automatically. That you should not keep anything for future. Do not build anything for future. So one thing is stopped, now the other thing, so by cleaning system or by fever or by any other disease, you may have it.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	So disease also plays its part?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Of course you are relieved, after a disease. I myself felt it. But now I do not feel at all, that I am relieved. I do not
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	But there is nothing much to relieve.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>		Suppose I'm not feeling well, something like that happens but I do not feel that, because that treasure has been snatched away to the Master who send it to the dogs.
</pre><pre>   I am ill, I used to say to my mother. Well I want to fall iii now, and it happened. Twice and thrice . . . ., in the third time or fourth time I said then, she almost pounced upon me to give a slap, "Whatever you say that happens, don't say that!".
</pre><pre>   Of course it was a real fact, I was feeling that ..., that samskaras are bad, impressions are there and now I?ll surely fall ill. They come to the heart first. That is symptom, that you will fall ill. Because I was a bit sensitive, and I felt it.
