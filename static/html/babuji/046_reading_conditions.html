And he was questioning, answering rightly. So when, that work of Chari finished, and I was talking with Mr. Davies. Then I said, "Well I tell you only one thing, remembrance of the sins make the impressions deeper". He said, "That was the problem I brought... I came". Accidentally I said. So I said I only tell you one thing, "Remembrance of the sin, makes the impression deeper".
