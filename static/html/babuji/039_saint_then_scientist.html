<pre>     Here, scientist was in India, long back, ages ago, but they were all saints. (Bharaddaurg ?) a philosopher and yogi both. First of all they will attempt God. When they feel that they are realised, then they will attempt other things, for the good of the world. First of all, their own making, afterwards seeking the ways of others making.
</pre><pre>    So science is not bad, it is useful. So after, when they retire from worshipping, in other words, retire then they take up this thing.
</pre><pre>    Now my work is completed, I have realised the goal, I have achieved the goal. Now for the betterment of the others. Now, (Bharaddaurg?) has given the weight of the stars. Physics, of course he must be knowing physics. Weight of the stars he has given, and aeroplane also he has given, and of course there is a sanskrit book, some "Adya Samadisht", he studied it and gave to Mr. Nehru. That is very colleged sanskrit work, it is not easily available, not current, in the present day. So it is difficult to know. There mercury they will, they used, mercury, in the aeroplane. Mercury flies and along it, it also flies. And once you feel the force, it is I think you can take work for about hundred years. Same material, and now you said it will be very expensive, so much mercury we cannot find.
