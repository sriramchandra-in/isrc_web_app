<pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	No, sir ...!
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	So what was the talk, just slipped away?
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Meditation and constant remembrance.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Yes, I was at the feet of the Master, 40 - 50 years ago. So there was so many 'satsangis', I think maybe 200, and Master was also there, and I was sitting aside. So, somehow this Layavastha in Brahm absorbency in Brahm, absorbency in God. So accidentally, or it may be his own wish, I immediately could notice the Layavastha in Master, in full. Of what strength it is, of what sort of it is, how he is absorbed, everything came to me. I studied immediately. After a minute or two again it came. I again, see, how it can be possible - third time again, three times. When three times . . . . that is the way. Now I've seen that is Layavastha is that, it has got so much strength, it has got so much volume, all these things I noticed. Now, now thinking and thinking as if I have taken in myself the whole thing. Well this is the thing to be acquired. Of course I was searching for Layavastha, I was doing some practise, but when I got the experience, when I saw this thing. Of course it was His wish, I am telling you, and nothing else.
</pre><pre>Then what I used to do? Constant remembrance continued to create Layavastha in myself. Not it is that 'I am laya, in Brahm, absorbed in Brahm, I mean God.' Not only meditating or thinking that I am ... I am absorbed in Brahm. The people also do it, but it is all artificial, I have written in 'Reality at Dawn' also.
</pre><pre>But how to create that condition, how to adjust ourselves to have that condition? Our thinking adjustment, . . . . Philosophical trend I had at that time, thinking capacity well developed. Even before going to my Master thinking capacity was very much developed, but he made it smooth and good. That is he reformed it. In other words, He reformed it, that was His work. So thinking was there, and I was coming generally to the correct conclusion.
</pre><pre>Now I began to work with it. I came to know in this way you can adjust. I began, not only that 'I am Layavastha in my Master, I am absorbed', not that thing. I was adjusting myself. And for three times only I say, "How to adjust?". Afterwards thinking helped, adjusting at the same time, two things, three things. What is the condition reigning in the centre I am in?
</pre><pre>Three things I used to do alone . . . all the time I devoted to this. Nobody would believe it. And moreover, in every month - of     course     after     higher reach, not in this region after higher reach - three days before, the day was fixed first. At each month, on each month at the first date I shall be in another region. Date fixed first. Now three days before, I used to know what is there. Now fourth thing also, let me see, so I was getting an air of it, even before I went there.
</pre><pre>Just suppose I go to Denmark. If I am at the seashore, well I will begin to - , environment, something will begin to come: Very good scenery, very good things, that idea. So similarly that used to ... And when I am there now for one month I'm What is happening in that? So that knowledge I have got. Of course I forget so many things, but something is there. So three, four things I used to do.
