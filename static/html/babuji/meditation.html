<pre><b>Babuji:</b> Your's is the trancendental meditation. I told him. That when you meditate in the inwards centres, fixed for meditation, it becomes trancendental. Every meditation becomes trancendental, if you meditate on some centre, on the outside it cannot be. And I'm telling you, sometimes you feel that you are meditating on the heart, but heart is not before your eyes. That means you trancendented, transcendental. Every meditation is trancendental. And Mahesh Yogi, of course, he calls his system as trancendental meditation, but I think it is not.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Why not ?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>   Because they take the outer help, and not from the essence. They do not proceed with the inner help, but from the outer help to the inner, and further on, I don't know.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> Thoughts
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Every thought has it own centre, and when it works in the centre, it becomes a pole itself. And when pole is there, polar changes will also be there. So there should be one change, that is, from bad to good. And there will be so many, so many changes, so confusion is the result.
