<pre>Abhyasi: When you talk about the solar system, it reminds me on the time when I was studying astrology.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	You know astrology ?, ?.. astrologer?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: Ja. But I left when I started in Sahaj Marg. I left it the subject because it was too heavy for me. It complicated things for me. As it before simplified things, it now started to be complicated, so I had to leave.
</pre><pre>Babuji: Here, everything comes in the end, but how to create that? That is of course, and you ask me what it was, only will and suggestion. Two things: will and suggestion.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Will and suggestion?
</pre><pre>Babuji: � � I'm telling you, I prayed my Master, to show how the world was born. What was the actions done by the God or by some energy, His energy. He showed me all the thing. At that time I started writing "Efficacy of Raj Yoga". So he showed me everything, formation of sun and everything. Well I've not kept it for . . . .
</pre><pre>Formation of sun, how it came. Everything. Revolving motion, everything, I've seen.
</pre><pre>   So that is . . . . of course it is due to my Master that I have seen that. And one man can create such a sort of vision himself, also.
</pre><pre>   Yogi really wants to have command over the powers of nature. He may utilize it, but it is always used for good cause. Not for annihilation, or some country.
</pre><pre>   It is sacred vow among the saints, that it will be utilized in good cause. In the rise of the humanity, here in India, I'm telling you. And so it was kept mostly confidential, only kings and their scientists will work. And not publically, the subject will not be taught publically. Only on this account. They will misuse it.
