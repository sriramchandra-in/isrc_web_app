<pre><b>Babuji</b>: When thought comes in contact with soul, the third thing produces and that is light. So it is not the…, it is a sort of material light, a sort of material light it is, and not of much use. I have told you that, when I was on the cot going to bed, I negativated it. I feel it disturbed, so light is not our goal.We proceed from light to grey. “From darkness to light” all system I said, “Darkness to light”. And I say, “light to grey”. And grey is the real colour. I’ve said, “Dawn colour”. I’m telling, this is a dawn colour.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: Yes. I wonder if you could remove your glasses, because so much light is coming, I cannot see your eyes. Thank you.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> So this thing, light is not a very valuable thing, but is something better. It shows that now you have come in contact with the soul, soul connection has been formed; that only it shows. Afterwards grey coluor. We say God, light and light. But it is all the material exposition. Because there is no other words, I find no other words, the better word. And I searched and searched that if I … you may have Danish, in German or in any language, I may adopt it, explaining it, but I am not getting. So I used, "Light without luminosity", in this way I used.
</pre><pre>So here I am telling you, light the people see, but afterwards, after a certain reach, grey colour. And grey colour contains darkness and light mixed. And there is one ..., Nasatya Sutra also say - in Rig Vedas, "There is neither light nor darkness, the sun never shines there". At the ultimate object.
</pre><pre>So this is the correct version. Of course, the spirituality has been shown in a different style, that is, tinged with matter. All, what we say, tinged with matter, not quite naked, as it is. And of course everybody says according to his reach and advancement, but if a man of the highest repose says something, that means whatever he says, is quite correct. So it requires a good deal of labour and must be a master like that to give you training in that line. Then you can feel it.
</pre><pre>This 'anand', I am telling you. Anand, the peace, oh I mean, bliss. For bliss I am telling you.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Yes, that I like very much.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> I am talking about my own experience. Of course was feeling very highly blissful, and what was effect? I wanted to break my head with the wall, in happiness, in blissful state. So I'm telling, I'm telling you. And it continued for three days.
</pre><pre>In case of Kasturi I am telling you. I came to know that she is on that state, blissful state. Then I said, "I shall keep her for one month".
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	For one month in that state, what ... How many
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>    Precautions I am telling you. There was one friend of mine Shri Ishwar Sahaï, I said, because she was at Lakhimpur Kheri and I was here in Shahjahanpur, "You write the letter daily, asking her condition". So he used to write about her daily. And I was controlling her, that she may not break the head and something. May do
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>something, she may do something else. This I was doing. So in the last days, may be 25 days after or 30 days after, she began to tear her 'dhoti', began to tear, so much happened. Then I took her off from that place. So bliss cannot be Of course, everybody passes, but those who are sensitive and in a way mixed with it, I use the word, mixed with it. They feel that. Well, you cannot bear the 'anandam'
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	How long time did she meditate before that stage arrived?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Well, this cannot be said.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	No, but she?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	She stayed for one month.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Yes, but I mean how long had she been in Sahaj Marg before?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	20 years now.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	20! But when that stage arrived?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Well, I do not remember, I think maybe in 7 - 8 years.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>   So she was just tearing her sari!
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> I myself witnessed and others also. And everybody passes through that stage. It is not that she
</pre><pre>But nobody feels like that. Intensity they do not feel at all - but they come to that stage, because the way is the same. Suppose you go to Denmark on aeroplane from Bombay. Now the route is fixed. Everybody passes, some see, "Very good scene! This is a very good scene". Some enjoy, others do not even like to peep into it, "Oh, it is going on ...". So where there is stress and emphasis on the will and the mind, then he will see the things as they are. And by the way, by the way, if you see, they have no value. So they see by the way, not going deep into it.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>   It's a shame not everybody can be sensitive?.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>   Beg your pardon
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	It's a shame that not everybody can be sensitive for these things.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Yes.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Perhaps they have it too early or something?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>     Too early of course. But this is very difficult point. Higher point it is, of course, not very high, but at least high. So bliss and anand the people say, but they cannot bear it, if it is actually there.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	(Hindi: M …… sometimes is that there?)
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> No, M …, I do not know the English word. Hindi word is 'avadhut', avadhut means you are charged in something and on account of that charging, you are almost benumbed or drowned in some condition.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Its too much.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Drowned, drowned in that condition. So this Avadhut, nobody can turn into avadhut in my, in our sanstha. So what is that? Suppose he has seen the light or any other thing, now he drowned in it, now he cannot go out of it. Throughout the life he will remain there, and he likes so much, that if you want to divert him, he will begin to beat you. So much he likes. That is called avadhut ... Momentary it may come for a minute or two, that is another thing, drowned. But that is, "Civilised madness", I should say.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> You had some saint in India, that went round and was just crazy with happiness all the time, all his life. Everybody worshipped him very much.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	I couldn't follow you much. That is, "You had ..."?
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	I have heard about one saint in India, in oldern days, I don't remember his name.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Yes?
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> And he was just running into the water and doing everything silly, because he was mad with happiness, with bliss. So people was just worshipping him.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>    I am telling you, there are so many saints like that in India, and so many fools also to appreciate them. Both things are there. They will use vulgar language, but I am telling you, for those who are uneducated masses. Suppose they use vulgar language, they are happy! 'Well, he is not in his proper senses, and he is telling
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>such vulgar language, using such a vulgar language.' They appreciate it. Well, a man in the state of delirium says something other, the people do not appreciate it. So that is the spiritual delirium in a way.</pre>
