<pre>And I am telling you, I tell everybody, "I got it cheaply, so I distribute it cheaply". But I didn't got cheaply, I am telling you, really speaking I didn't got cheaply, I laboured also. Master has given very cheaply, so I give cheaply. So no fee, nothing of the sort. I said to ... Yes, he said, Rajagopalachari when he spoke first in Italy, he said, "There is no fee for it". I must explain to myself, it is not that I got money. I got so many things. Not that. Money, no money. Free service, that is good idea?

</pre><pre>(Hindi:	Short	exchange	regarding	food	preparation.	Question	on	morning meditation and constant remembrance).
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> This constant remembrance is the artery, artery â€¦ is the artery of development. I don't know whether I have used the word wrong or right. Main artery.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Through which the blood of grace runs down from God to us. Isn't it?
</pre><pre>Yes, yes. Metaphorically.</pre>
