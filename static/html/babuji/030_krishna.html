<pre>   So I have written in that "Efficacy of Raj Yoga" also, for Krishna yes ?.. We come from the spiritual point, that is human beings, and prophets come ?.. with Mahamaya, the lower point. Look here, we come from the spiritual point, and they come from Mahamaya. That is center of power. Mahamaya is centre of power. So they come with power, and we create it here.

</pre><pre>   Spiritual point we come when we are improved. Now these things are given, in other words, to us.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> (Hindi: You ?.. ) you just now said, Krishna has only destructive powers and other yogis have both destructive and constructive.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> No, yogis will always have constructive powers, rarely he will be given destructive power also.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> So can't we say Krishna was not a yogi?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Krishna was not a yogi, this is correct, but yogi powers were there, because he brought with. He brought those powers with him. He did not reacquire that power and he got this power from the very birth. But that was the difference. Here acquire, acquiring is not necessary there, and here acquiring is necessary.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> For a prophet, it is natural with him, by birth, he doesn't acquire, like Lord Krishna?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> No. But I'm telling you, there are so many, in Mohammedan ?.. Of course there are so many and I don't know, actually remember more than maybe a hundred, I don't know. So there are so many prophets. There are Moses and so on. Christ, Moses, and there are other narres also, 4 or 5 or 6 I know.
