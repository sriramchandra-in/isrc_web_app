<pre>   I have written in "Efficacy of Raj Yoga". It is we who give them power. Them means, powers of nature. As in Greece, Athena is called the goddess of war, Athena . Athena, goddess of war. So, any deity, they began, for any deity they began to � � � � they began to think. If she is war deity and something like that. Here
</pre><pre>also, Kali Devi is the goddess of destruction. But it is, of course	, both powers are
</pre><pre>there.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>   Destructive and constructive, both powers . . . And yogi of higher standard they get command over it.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Both of them?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Both of them. Constructive and destructive. And prophets come, generally, I'm telling you, they have command over destruction. Destructive power. Not on constructive power.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> Prophets ? <b>Babuji:</b> Prophets. <b>Abhyasi:</b> Like?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Like Krishna. I'm telling you, an example like Krishna.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	You mean, he didn't have constructive power?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Constructive power, no; destructive power he had. Because, he has to destroy, demolish the building and then to grow something higher.
</pre><pre>When I talk, I talk very freely
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	When you talk you ...?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	I talk very freely. Because truth should reach you.
</pre><pre> And these bhaktas - I mean saints, they're generally given both, not generally, they are given constructive power. And if need arises, suppose for the change of the world, then they are given destructive also, - constructive, they bring constructive power. But destructive also; but rarely they are given. When nature wants some change or overhauling of the world, then those two things.</pre>
