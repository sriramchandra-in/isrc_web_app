<pre>Babuji: ï¿½ No, I am taking you all, as soon as possible, but so many things have to be corrected. Permission can be given, but thoughts and everything should remain like that. Suppose if I say one, one day or two days. It is possible, even in one minute, two minutes it is possible, but not in all cases, that is also correct. It may be possible in some cases. But there will be no enfoldment, they will not see. Gradually it will evolve, and suppose enfoldment is also there, then man cannot suffer it.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Enfoldment what is that?
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Enfoldment means coming to the proper order.
