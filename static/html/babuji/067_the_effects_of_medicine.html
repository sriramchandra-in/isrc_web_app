<pre>     Another story runs. There is one . . . . treatment, the man died now. So I had pain, I went to him, "Let us start his treatment". He gave me two or three pills. "You take one pill in the morning, and the other after two three hours", as the doctor said, "and the third pill at this time". When I took the first pill I was alright, when I took the second pill, the heaviness throughout the system. I said to Ravindra Rao, my associate, that I am feeling this thing. (Hindi: He said), "I may go to him, to bring another . . . ." (Hindi: I said), "Please don't do". I neutralized it by my will force.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>     And the next day when I reached there I said, "The second, when I took second pill, I found very heaviness in my whole of my nervous system". Then he began to see in this way, "What is the cause of it?" Again he said "What is the cause of it?" Two, three times he said. And one of my associates said, "He is a spiritualist". Then he began to talk on that line. He said, "Now I am telling you, I am telling you. Your body strength is totally gone. And you must have died by this time. Bodily strength is totally gone, but mental energy is very much increased, and that is controlling all, controlling the body and the mind". And he was correct too.
</pre><pre>     What happens? Of course, suppose if there is a thief, and he left it out. But at least he left out the stealing. But in ideas, "That will be jewelry well you have got golden?. Something?." He may not take it because he was firm. He may not take it, but idea will also be there.
</pre><pre>     Similarly our senses if they are subdued in any way, at least they will give the idea. They � will give � the � idea of that kind. � So � what happens? That work is taken out from those centres. And higher centres begin to work. That is, mind � centre � is � the � higher � centre. � Now � instead � of � that, � they � are dismissed from the service. Those, what do you call, 'indriyas' (Hindi: senses), you call, senses. Those senses have been dismissed from the service, and another came in its charge. The best man has come in charge and that is mind centre. So really speaking, mind centre have come.
</pre><pre>     And afterwards what happens? Divine centre control the mind centre, and mind centre come? . In other words, Divine itself controls the centres, the senses.
</pre><pre>So if you give this thing in the paper, the people say what, I am telling you?...
</pre><pre>This is Sahaj Marg system.
</pre><pre>You, you, you note it down and remember it. Abhyasi: It is here all . . . .
</pre><pre>Babuji: ??
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Behind lock.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	And so many good things. And so many?..all higher thoughts or lower thoughts.
</pre><pre>What, you can consider it. Nobody has said so frankly as I said.
