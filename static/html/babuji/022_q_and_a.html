<pre>   Then, there was one American, he was against Mahesh Yogi. I was sitting in the room. He came and sat on the chair, easy chair. Then I said to Parthasarathi, that I am going out of the room to give transmission, but the man has some purpose. But he didn't tell me anything, so how can I call him? Then he himself came and he says, "This Mahesh Yogi is robbing our money". But why do you,
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>why ? And that means you yourself want that you may be robbed. So let him . . . .
</pre><pre>let him do it.
</pre><pre>   He said, "Indian oppinions are not good." And everybody asked my opinion about him. I said well, "His motive is good. So he is a good man. He want to calm down your disturbed mind. So he is a good man. You should see, see the motive. Motive is good", I say always . . . . this. Why should I say otherwise to any saint. Of course they are doing good work, no doubt. Of which standard. That of course you cannot decide.
