<pre>Abhyasi:	He was parting the power in three.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	He ?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Wasn't he, parting the power in three? The Father,
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Power he had, power you have also got.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes, but I mean he was explaining the power as, by what do you call it?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Dividing into three.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	The Father, the Son, and the Grace.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Holy Ghost (hindi: three in one, Son, Father, Holy Ghost).
</pre><pre>Babuji: The Son, the Father, and the Ghost, Holy Ghost.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	(Hindi: In three powers they have put it)
</pre><pre>Babuji:	The Holy Ghost, (Hindi: This I don't understand), Holy Ghost?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	(Danish: Holy Spirit; what is it called? Holy Spirit?)
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	What exactly is The Holy Ghost ?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Ja,I don't know.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	We don't know.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	It must be some kind of grace.
</pre><pre>Babuji: � You can call the subtle body as holy ghost it will be right. - Astral body - Holy Ghost - it would be right.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: Yes I think. Father means God, Son Christ, and The Holy Ghost the tempting desires, may be called as The Holy Ghost because it was the Ghost, Holy Ghost who tempted Adam and Eve and all that. Maybe like that?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Ah, no, no, no.
</pre><pre>Babuji:� � Parthasarathi will explain it. I shall ask this question about The Holy Ghost. Well, he has read the Bible and he remembers.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: And sometimes after they started to worship Maria, the mother of Christ. Why?
</pre><pre>This is a funny thing I think.
</pre><pre>Babuji: I couldn't follow.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: Why did they start worshipping Mary? Afterwards and all?
</pre><pre>Babuji: Because it was Christ's mother.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: Ja.
</pre><pre>Babuji: That's all.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	But actually she had nothing to do with the thing.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	She was a mother, she gave him birth.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Ja.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: they call Pundit Nehru, Motilal Nehru and Ghandi, Father Son and the Holy Ghost.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Is there a being known as the divine mother?
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Well we can call him divine mother or real mother, or anything you can call.
</pre><pre>Words you have got.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>Mary, you can call her, because she was mother, you can call her many things.
</pre><pre>Of course she must be respected, because she gave birth of such a great soul.
