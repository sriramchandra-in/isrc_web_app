<pre>but can it be said to be a goal itself: realisation of unity?
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Goal itself ? Realisation ?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes.
</pre><pre>Babuji: Realisation is our chief-object, and what is realisation? It is very difficult to define, but somehow I am telling you. What is realisation?
</pre><pre>   That you may become a real man. And not the real God. You should become a real, real man - that means you are realised. And then states are there, balanced states. I often say that, balanced state, and so many other things are there, no pain and no sorrows. These are the qualities of that.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	No pain, no sorrows.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	That means calm!
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes.
</pre><pre>Babuji:� � If it comes, suppose it comes, we are all worldly people, suppose it comes, it diverts.
</pre><pre>   Of course, if a man falls down from the roof he gets hurt, you are ... you are moved, that is you feel sorrow for it, that is natural. And you do not feel sorry for it, or you do not help him, that means you are not man.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: (Danish: A good explanation. There are so many who are frightened of becoming hard-hearted).
</pre><pre>Babuji: Many people if they hear your statement that you will be free from sorrow and free from all these things - they will fear, "What is this. Then I am not human any longer".
</pre><pre>   I never said free from sorrow. I never said ?.. At least in my words, free yourself from freedom.
</pre><pre>Babuji: In this way. Freedom from freedom. I wrote an article and it was written myself,... 'Liberation is itself a bondage'. So they are very high thoughts, nobody could grasp
</pre><pre>. . . . Of course I wanted to put that heading. Then our people said, "You don't put that heading". Yes, yes, in the body you can describe, in the body of it. Then I discussed in the body of it. Because such a � � � � they will throw away, they will not
</pre><pre>read the . . Look at it yourself, because idea is there. That is, if the idea of liberation is there, that means you are entangled with it. You are not free. You are entangled in the freedom, in that, what do you call?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Freedom.
</pre><pre>Babuji: � Freedom. That means a sort of entanglement, entanglement is also there, that should be lost. In realisation, you don't care for realisation ..., I mean, you don't care for freedom, or don't care for anything, that carelessness is produced, because you are gone, you have gone far beyond it, far beyond these things. So these things are just a bail for the , just a puppet for the small boy.
</pre><pre>But I am telling you these thoughts, only I have said so far, nobody has said.
</pre><pre>Commitment� � � � I do not know, they have said.
</pre><pre>   So the people you see, when they see it ?.. Please explain it, I'll have explanation from you. But their heart expect, accept the thing, because in reality heart accept it.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes heart accept it.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Intellectually they may discuss, that is another thing.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Very good point.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Hum?
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	How long time will it take for a person to make his heart stronger than head?
