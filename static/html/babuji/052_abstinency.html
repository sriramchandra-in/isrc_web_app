<pre>Abhyasi: Abstinence, - sexual abstinence, you have talked about, but abstinence in other things?
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Gradually, they all set right.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes, it will be balanced.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	Gradually. And this meditation, everything, is for that.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi: But should we not try to go directly to that ... aim?. We should try only to aim at meditation and peace and going into that line; and then the other things will be balanced automatically, or should we concentrate also in trying to avoid exaggerations or ...?
</pre><pre>Babuji: So I'm telling you, suppose your hands are soiled with clay, and you have to take food, as we take, with the hand. You will surely wash the hands!
</pre><pre>   In this way, these are like that. These things which are coming, just you have complained, these things are coming, so that should be washed out. They are appearing in this way, as you are talking this time. Ail should be washed out, then you will sit for the food. So in meditation or spirituality we have ... we really search for some charm in it. There must be something; there must be some experience. So you are attached to the charm alone, and not to the reality, and reality has no charm. It is all simple. There is no charm at all.
</pre><pre>So in	, we want to enter into the spirituality with the world we have made.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	Yes.
</pre><pre>Babuji:	With the world we have made, with our thoughts and so on, and so forth.
</pre><pre>Abhyasi:	And that is not possible?
</pre><pre>Babuji: And so they appear. They appear in that way. Why? So that they are ... really speaking they are leaving the field. When they are centered, they want to, now, to come out, and when you meditate a sort of vacuum is created and they come, and you say it is our experience. If it is a good thing, then it is our experience, it is a very good meditation. No good and bad, everything should be wiped out from the heart, good and bad, both things, then balanced.
