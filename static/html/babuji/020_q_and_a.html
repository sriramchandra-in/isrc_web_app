<pre>B: I think you have got
</pre><pre>Then we will read my quotation about kundalini. There it is given with diagram.
</pre><pre>And here in tantric literature, they say so many things about kundalini. A man can fly, a
</pre><pre>man can do this thing, this miracle, everything. I don't care, only two, three things are
</pre><pre>there. Nothing of the sort.
</pre><pre>A: Why do people aspire for kundalini?
</pre><pre>B: Well, when they commit so many mistakes, one of the mistakes is also, is this also.
</pre><pre>I never aspired for kundalini. I did not know even that my kundalini is
</pre><pre>awakened. Of course, I suspected only, that's all. But Master said, "You've awakened
</pre><pre>kundalini of this person". Then I came to know I've got power, my kundalini is also
</pre><pre>awakened. Then I came to know for certain.
</pre><pre>A: I guess, at a certain state, it gets awakened automatically.
</pre><pre>B: Automatically also  So there is a case of that sort also. When it starts automatically, there
</pre><pre>is a pain. And I suffered from this pain for 2-3 years. Not all the time, sometimes a vein, a
</pre><pre>vein ..., in doing something like that and it produces pain. I am going and I got the pain
</pre><pre>immediately.
</pre><pre>A: Where do you get the pain?
</pre><pre>B: Here, below the navel.
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>Here I got it. In this way I begin to study. Sometimes I'm going. In the office I'm
</pre><pre>going out and I felt there. I immediately got hold of that ... chair and sat, of course 1, 2,
</pre><pre>3 minutes after, it was over. And a friend of mine said, "What . • • • pain immediately it
</pre><pre>started. And gone also".
</pre><pre>So Kasturi was feeling that sort of pain, ...
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>A: So she ...
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>B: Yes Kasturi was feeling, so I studied and said the pain is here. No not there. Her mother
</pre><pre>was also there. I said, "Do you feel pain below the navel?" (Hindi: She said), "Yes". Then her
</pre><pre>mother said, "Well, I go to the doctor for this purpose". (Hindi: I said), "Please don't go". And
</pre><pre>immediately, it was prepared, immediately I touched it, and it was awakened, there was no
</pre><pre>pain at all. Not this type of pain that you cannot bear. Of course to a certain extent it was
</pre><pre>unbearable, in my case. To a certain extent.</pre>
