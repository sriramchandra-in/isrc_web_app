<pre>    If I recite ..., some mantra we get peace (Hindi: I said), I'm telling you, multiplication table, two into two is four, two into three is six and you repeat it hundred times and then sit in meditation, and you will find peace. Hundred times recite, and you say, "Please do it". Just now you can do it. He was quiet.
</pre><pre>This Mahesh Yogi probably prescribes meditation on mantras.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>		He tells you some name and then you go on repeating that, and all this, over and over again.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>		And it has to be what, you get a word from him and you has to keep it as a secret, but there is only twelve different words.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	How many? Twenty?
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> Twelve, one for each month.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> Last night, last night I was thinking on that point. I do not prescribe any mantra.
</pre><pre>Mantra is like throwing the brick back on God.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	Like throwing the brick back on God.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> But that will draw his attention, alright Babuji.
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> But I thought, I'm telling you, but it is not a play of an ordinary man.
</pre><pre>You can produce life in mantras. I don't think there will be a very few persons.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b> What do you mean by produce life?
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b> You just recite, suppose, (Sanskrit ?. ), Sanskrit, now, it is "Sandhya", you just read yourself and effect of it you take in air, and transmit that effect.
</pre><pre><b>Abhyasi:</b>	And life is created?
</pre><pre><b>Babuji:</b>	Life is created. But it is not the work of an ordinary man, solution I got last night.
