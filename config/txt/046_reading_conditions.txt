Abhyasi: � Yes.
Babuji: � Yes.
Abhyasi:	But he won't do it, . . . .
Abhyasi:	What?

But as the thoughts changes, that reflection of it also . . . .
Abhyasi:	What about this sentence that the eyes are the mirror of the soul?

Babuji: A man met me at Trichnapalli, South India. And my friend, Mr. Davies and Mrs. Davies were also . . . . Since we were talking with them, and I didn't pay any attention to that gentleman, but I came to know that he wants some answer for the questions. I said, "Mr. Chari you please satisfy him". And he was questioning, answering rightly. So when, that work of Chari finished, and I was talking with Mr. Davies. Then I said, "Well I tell you only one thing, remembrance of the sins make the impressions deeper". He said, "That was the problem I brought... I came". Accidentally I said. So I said I only tell you one thing, "Remembrance of the sin, makes the impression deeper".
   So what is done is done, we should not think of the past at all. But we should build the future. And that is wisdom.
