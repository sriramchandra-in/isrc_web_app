Thomas said that in Denmark long back, once, we talked about visions and so on. If visions were real visions or self-created or something, then Thomas said, "I think every single vision is only cleaning!"
Babuji:	That's correct
Abhyasi:	Correct ? !
But there will also be some higher visions isn't it, some message or something?
Babuji: Maybe, I am telling you, mostly they are past ?. There are two types of visions: imaginative and divine. So really, generally I may say, they are having imaginative and not divine. Divine, then it is ?. you will feel something, all around you. That is divine, divine thoughts.
And when you are .....
And here in - what do you call - I forgot the idea.
Abhyasi: Divine all around.
Babuji:� � Divine. Divine will be the conditions. Suppose you are peaceful you will find all the atmosphere peaceful. I have written in my book, what do you call, in the first series. I have written that there, . . . . taken up that subject too. My feelings, about it, of course good and bad thoughts both were there. I was not free from bad thoughts I am telling you. But all, bit by bit, they have all gone. And how? Mind can think only one thing at a time. Just you think some other good. Suppose bad thought comes to you, then divert your attention towards it. Now mind now you have given another toy, now forget the former one.
