Abhyasi: � Then I think some fear will be in some people, when they sit for meditation and have cleaning also. They will think, what am I being shaped into?
Babuji: There, tell him the method. What is prescribed, should be done. And that will bring the result, you want.
Abhyasi:	And they can check up by feeling, the peace and good things come?
Babuji:� � No, no. What is coming, let it come. Don't disturb it, what is coming. Whether it will be good or bad. If it is good, it is leaving its own centre, and coming out.
   A bottle; cork is there, you put wine in it, it will go,... if you take out the cork and you will pour out the wine. And when you want to take it out you will, what do you call,� � � take out the cork and you do in this way. That is, the way it enters, that is the way to come out. Wine entered into the bottle, in this way, when you take . . .
Abhyasi:	That is the cleaning process you explain?
Babuji: � � No, I am telling you this. And when you want, that, to empty the bottle, you will do the reverse process.
    Similarly here, - at that time, anything which is coming to you, that is coming, coming out from the bottle, it was imprisoned. Coming out from the bottle, and this impressions are very near the heart, so they come down. There will ..., there must all will be cleaned. Otherwise no freedom.
Abhyasi: � How can people know, that it is their own impressions that they get and that they are not mixed with the preceptor or something? How can they know, be very sure in this thing, how can they have very much confidence, only by heart feeling?
Babuji: No, please repeat again.
Abhyasi: � I mean if they start feeling a lot of things, how will they be sure that it is from they own bottle?
Babuji: What is the necessity, ... what is the necessity. Suppose you are hungry and you are getting the bread. Why you care for that?
Abhyasi: I don't ...
Babuji: Suppose you are hungry, and you take that bread.
Abhyasi: That is very simple way.
Babuji: So we should be unmindful of all these things. Proper idea should be, waiting for God. That is ... you should ..., that naturally it will come. It is natural result of the meditation.
