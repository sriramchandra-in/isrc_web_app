You can know what is going to be happen, or what are the stars, favourable. This thing you can know. I've not learned astrology at all, although I've brought some counsellors . . . . my relation with astrologers and astrology was the same. But I
didn't learn because I, because that was, I was a student and still I am a student of the Master.
   So if I will see through the astrology, the temperament of any person, I shall use naturally that intuitive force.
Abhyasi: Intuitive.
Babuji: Intuitive force, I said.
Abhyasi: Yes.
Babuji: Because that is predominant. So what is the use of psychology then?
Abhyasi: That was what I found too.
Babuji: And why should I use it. Intuitive faculty for that.
