A: Babuji, in case of Christ, as I know there was no such thing as construction, or destructive powers with him.
B: No, I'm telling you, I always praise Christ. But I do not compare him with anyone. Because he has given good things. How kind hearted he was. Sermon on the Mount, . . . . it moved me very much. It may not be applicable in day to day life. But look to the broader heart of the Christ. The man must be appreciated. His spiritual condition only God knows. But what we see we must appreciate it.
A: The commandments Christ was given, is quite negative You must not do this or you must not do that.
B: You must not do it, he was right, ?.. what I say, "Do it". But that is the difference. You must not do it, he is the right, he is not wrong, but I say first do it.


Do the meditation first. Afterwards we will see the result. Do it, I don't say, "Don't do it".
