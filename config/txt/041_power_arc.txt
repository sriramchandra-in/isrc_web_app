   I am telling you, our scientists have not yet discovered the arc. I mean, power- arc.
A:	Power- what?
B: Power-arc, I named it. One atom is there and one atom is there, now they are connected with the power so that a circle may be complete. Otherwise circle will not be complete. It will exhaust. The power-arc, power-arcs are very powerful.
A:	It is dangerous to discover?
B:� � Of course you can ..., dangerous ..., of course I studied in this way, whether I can use in our day to day life. But so far as I know they are not, they cannot be used in a spiritual way. So I left it. I said to Mr. Andre Poray also the same thing, (Hindi: I said), "Well I am not a scientist otherwise I would have done wonders". (Hindi: he said), "You are the scientist, but laboratory is needed.
One atom here, other atom here or near about, now it is connected with the arc.
   And moreover it has got its solar system also. Every atom has got its solar system. When it is destroyed then the atom comes another comes in its place.
A:	I don't understand all this ?..
B: � � So our scientist has not yet discovered solar system of the atom. And moreover, I'm telling you, one side of the atom can neutralise the other side. And that nobody knows. So that you may, what you call, neutralise the effect of the bomb. But, if anything is discovered like that, that it can be transferred to that ... atom bomb will not work.
And I think, this thing we should know all.
A:	But how to do that?
B:	Beg your pardon.
A:	How to do that?
B:	Only will.
A:	Will, yes.
