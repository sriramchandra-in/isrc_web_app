Babuji: There is no translation of pain. Pain does it mean, does it mean that you are feeling something here? I don't know things . . . . actual that . . . . but there is no word, I want to say.
   Of course in Urdu there is a word, but the same word, no other word, a sort of restlessness. This pain is sort of restlessness. Not the disease.
Abhyasi:	What is the Urdu word for it?
Babuji:	Dard.
Sufis and everybody in Persia have used this word.
Abhyasi: No, it was always because you wrote that on your way you had so much pain so if you were not in a spiritual ... person ?
Babuji:	That is about, serpent fire I said, kundalini. Probably I might have said this thing.
Abhyasi:	You've written in this book on the front page, that ?..
Babuji:	People hanker after peace, so how can they be induced to take up restlessness?
Abhyasi:	No, it is not that,
Babuji:� � ?.. longing for the realisation of the object. Had there not been the the work of the Master I would have commit suicide, that means ?. So pain I had, so inclination I had, so craving for Reality, it means that.
