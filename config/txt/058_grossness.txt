Babuji:	I am telling you, grossness is there also, as in India, but it is of different type.

Babuji: ï¿½ No, no, I am telling you, grossness is there, but of a peculiar type. Idol worship is not there.
Abhyasi:	No.
Babuji:	And that idol worship spoils a man altogether.
Abhyasi:	Spoils a man altogether.
