Babuji: Spirituality is not governed by anybody. Spirituality is not governed. And this body is governed by somebody ..., can be governed by somebody. Spirituality cannot be governed by anybody.
Abhyasi: (Danish: Questioning what Babuji meant.)
Babuji: So we leave the body idea.
Abhyasi: Yes but govern, isn't it that the guru, yourself, leads us, governs us on the way, because you know where we are going?
Babuji:	Well, if you are very much sensitive, you will know the condition.
     And Master only praised for me for that also. That whatever he feels, he writes. Well, in a very simple way. He expresses well, and he shown my diaries to
other satsangis, professors and so on. (Hindi: He said),"This is the way of writing diary." And he kept it safe as a valuable document throughout his life.
Abhyasi:	That is what you are releasing now?
Babuji:	Yes.
So many things have lost, since I started, so that work is there.
