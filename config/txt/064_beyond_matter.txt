Abhyasi: Now we are very fond of science in the West, is it ... In the long run I suppose all yoga can also be explained scientifically.
Babuji: No, something should be explained scientifically also, when beyond matter it cannot be explained.
Abhyasi: It cannot. Never?
Babuji: Science cannot help.
Abhyasi: Never?
Babuji: No instrument can help. It is beyond matter.
Abhyasi: Ja, you have said something science ...,
Babuji: And you have to leave that plane.
Abhyasi: Yes. So that means people have to follow their intuition, and see if, ...
Babuji: No, they should sit as they, ... they should, they should sit as they ... for which they are seeking.
Abhyasi: For which ?
Babuji:� � You are seeking God. Subconsciously, in your mind. Subconsciously. We should sit in meditation at that time, and what comes to pass or what happens at that time, however you need not care for it. If it is a good thing, you will like it. If it is a bad thing you will not like it, but we should have no idea but of meditation.
    If you are drifted away by the force of thought, well you remember, come back. Let it happen what will happen. It is all ..., whatever you feel during meditation, good or bad, it is all for good.
