     Devotion. Everybody, every saint, every prophet including Christ and here Krishna, everybody has said devotion. But what is the work of the devotion?
     The work of the devotion is only to take you, to take you to the goal. You've left certain things, but you do not know where it is. So that devotion, loving, that takes you there, takes you there. And when it comes to its proper place, that means the realisation, devotion, devotion is not there.
Abhyasi:	Ja. You said that to me once, devotion also comes to an end.
Babuji:	Yes.
Abhyasi:	I was very shocked.
Babuji: And nobody has said so, nobody. Because it has worked, what is the necessity of that? When you are, thoroughly in Him, what is the need of devotion? Suppose you create devotion in any way, it is useless. Its work, its work is over.
Abhyasi:	Ja.
Babuji:	And if I say this thing to our Indian Brothers, will not like this idea at all.
Abhyasi:	No, the Indians?
Babuji:	Indians, they will not like, because nobody has so. All along they say, "Devotion.
Devotion", and I, I also say that, devotion. But it ends at a certain point.
Abhyasi: And what point is that, relating to heart, mind, center?
Babuji: That is, when you become absorbed, when you become absorbed in reality or Brahma or God or . . .
Abhyasi: ï¿½ Is it in Central region?
Babuji: Central region.
