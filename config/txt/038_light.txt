     Every saint has asked for, asked for light, "Oh God give me light", and light is the only word which can express something. And it looks beautiful also, when there is light before you. A man has questioned, a man has said somewhere in South India, "I want light and light and nothing else". All light.
    I told him, "If there is light you cannot see the man behind". You cannot see the man behind, so what is the use of the light? When you cannot see God, light


you see and not the God himself. When light is there you cannot see man behind it. So if you are in search of light and light that is wrong. Because you will not be able to see the man behind it. Or in other words, realisation. So what is, I have written in "Efficacy of Raj Yoga", you should read again and again, then you will understand much, there I have written.
    Yes. "There is neither light nor darkness, the sun never shines there". So between light and darkness that is the chief thing. Like a dawn colour I have written, like a dawn. There is no light at all. Light is material, it has got weight also.
    I have not, I knew that it has got weight. Now the scientist say, and I wrote it. I said, Reality ... Light is far heavier than reality. That means, heavy, means weight. So I feel that light is there and it has got weight, and everything, I feel that.
    Of course science, scientist has got brain, and they have trained their brain to some other line. And I have also got brain, you have also got brain. You can also think. So for thinking I can help him, the scientist. But I cannot help him how to prepare a bomb. That I ......
A:	What?
B:	A bomb.
A:	A bomb !
B:		That I do not know. How to utilise that. In the spiritual way I know, its utilization, but not in But that is wisdom.
