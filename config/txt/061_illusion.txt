Babuji: � � Maya, he said Maya is illusion. And I believe Maya is not illusion. It is the power of God.
Maya is the power of God. And similarly, why they say, they may say of course ..., I have not read so far, that they have called world as illusion. For Maya they have said, for world they have said nothing. And I say, don't spoil the world.
