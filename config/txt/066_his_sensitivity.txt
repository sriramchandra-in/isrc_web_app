So, I am telling you, I was sensitive, I was very much sensitive. And now I am tired of my sensitiveness.
Abhyasi:	(Danish: "I am tired of my sensitivity"!)
Babuji: So I am telling you, you give me a bottle for some disease, and if I see over it I can tell you, it will, it will be useful for me or not.
Abhyasi:	You can see it ?
Babuji: ï¿½ Yes, I can read. But I stopped all these things. Because suppose I commit mistake, I can commit mistake also, . . . . I'm also human being. Suppose, it is given for
the good, to take off the pain or something like that, it is given. And my idea is there, that will also work.
Abhyasi: Ja.
Babuji: So I have stopped all this, but I am telling you, and Dr. Kuppuswamy of Tirupati when he found this thing, he entered into the mission. He gave me a medicine. I was some confusion in the heart, I said to Kuppuswamy just after five minutes, "The disease is there in the heart, but your ..., what you call, medicine, is working in the chest. What is that?"
Then he was astonished, "This is correct". He wanted to give that sort of medicine, that is correct, it is working on the lungs and not on the heart. Afterwards he said, "Well I am give you sleeping pills. So that you may have good sleep". (Hindi:I said) "Look here, I do not want to take it". But since he was a doctor, "But since you are telling me I shall take it, but throughout night I will not get sleep at all". And I didn't get sleep at all. Then he asked Doctor ..., "What sort of man he is?" What sort of man he is.
Then he said, "He is spiritual.", and he joined the Mission, only on that account.
