   There was a saint, in (Hardwar?), . . . . I always forget the name. He used to give title on his birthday. 'Saint'. And some 'Paramsaint', - paramsaint means higher than the saint. And yogi used to give and what is the use of this, unless the condition is there? And so I was tempted to give title, not on any occasions, I gave title to Kasturi, anybody can see whether she is a saint or not
   So Dr. Varadachari asked that you have copied such sad figure. Quite, I copied. He gives so many I give only one. So please see if she is saint or not. Shivananda, Shivananda.
Yes, Shivananda used to give title. What is the use of the title?
Abhyasi: � Yes, I know.
Babuji: Suppose there is an animal I begin to call him man, will he become man?
