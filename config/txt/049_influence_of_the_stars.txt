Abhyasi: Astrologers is thinking about the planets as influencing us, what do you say about this? Are we influenced of the ?
Babuji:	Yes influence is there, as I feel.
Abhyasi:	Different kind of influence from different planets?
Babuji: You see it is, ah ... spiritually it is possible. Suppose there is unfavourable star. Unfavourable star is sun, suppose. So, it is focusing some power, or something like that. That is influencing, some influence is there over our particular . . . . It can be removed and other thing you got. It can be removed, other thing you got. I tested,
twice or thrice, then Master said, "You are meddling with nature, don't do it". And it is very easy task. Now a minute, a minute is enough. Only half a minute is enough. Just pull it out and focusing there, transformation.
Abhyasi: ï¿½ They also think that different stones in rings can protect people from influence of the planets.
Babuji: Yes, they say that, and Ouspensky has also said something. You see the Armenian, Russian.
Abhyasi:	As a person progresses spiritually then the planets and the stars	,
Babuji:	It has no concern with that.
Abhyasi:	?.. don't have ...
Babuji: It has no concern with that. However I'm telling you, but it is not a childish play to remove, remove the effect of any star and bring another favourable, effect of, favourable star. Not an easy matter . . ?Of course it is ?.. by will it is possible. Unfailing will, if the will is unfailing.
Abhyasi:	When the mind becomes peaceful ?. Babuji:	Mind of course, that is another subject. Abhyasi:	I see.
Babuji:	(Hindi: Who was it on the telephone?)
Abhyasi: Does it mean that the influence, when we progress spiritually, will still be there, but we just react different?
Babuji: I'm telling you, you see, it does not concern with spirituality. Although a little aid, when it is in the favourable column, you get some aid. Something like that. But a spiritual condition, what you acquire, they cannot change. No.
Abhyasi:	I just thought we maybe, reacted different on it, when we progress spiritually.
Babuji:	Yes, it has no concern, that is only answer.
Abhyasi: I wanted to ask, it may be true, it may not be true. Suppose Mars, the particular planet, it is having bad effect upon the person, and suppose that person is going to
have irritation in the mind, and while doing meditation his mind is peaceful, is it not that effect of Mars ... ?
Babuji: I'm telling you, wind is blowing, it has effect on you, whether you are spiritual or non-spiritual, similar in the case here.
